# SCT_DS_1
Population Distribution Visualization

This repository demonstrates how to create visualizations (bar charts and histograms) to analyze the distribution of categorical and continuous variables in a dataset.

For example:

Categorical variable: Gender distribution in a population.

Continuous variable: Age distribution in a population.

The project uses Python with pandas and matplotlib/seaborn to process the dataset and create meaningful charts.

=> Repository Contents

population_distribution_viz.ipynb â†’ Jupyter Notebook containing data loading, processing, and visualization code.

Example visualizations:

Bar chart for categorical variables (e.g., gender).

Histogram for continuous variables (e.g., age).

=> Visualizations

Bar Chart
Used for categorical variables like gender. It shows the count (or frequency) of each category.

Histogram
Used for continuous variables like age. It groups values into bins and shows the frequency distribution.

=> How to Run

git clone https://github.com/your-username/population-distribution-viz.git
cd population-distribution-viz


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook population_distribution_viz.ipynb


Run all cells to generate the charts.
